# Mail Attachments

## Features

The Mail Attachments extension provides a framework for sending e-mail with file
attachments. It does not do anything on its own but adds functionality to
extensions that implement this framework.

Extensions can implement the framework by:

* using its form definition for adding elements to their e-mail-related forms
  for allowing users to add attachments of different types to e-mail.
* providing attachment types that are being hooked up by the framework and made
  available to all extensions implementing the form.

The extension is licensed under [AGPL-3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0).
